# Adder_test
launching like this:
`make SIM=verilator && make report`

Afterword:
I'm usually a proponent of using PBT and Golden tests, but this time I came across cocotb and thought I didn't have the energy to deal with integrating these tools.
After writing all the testcases I realised that I should have done it a bit trickier, maybe add a class that would check flags, but I guess I'm really tired (and it's not about this assignment, just overlapping...).
